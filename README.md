# Tsunami Prediction From Earthquake Data

This project involves using a dataset to predict the occurrence of a tsunami based on various metrics from earthquakes around the world. This project is dependent on the 'earthquake_data_tsunami.csv' file. To run this code, download 'TsunamiPredictionFromEarthquakeData.ipynb' and 'earthquake_data_tsunami.csv' and upload to an IDE such as Google Collab.
